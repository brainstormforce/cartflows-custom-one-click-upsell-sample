# Custom Gateway integration Sample

This is the skeleton or wireframe for creating a plugin to add custom support to your payment gateway for the CartFlows upsell and downsell features.

To start adding the custom support, follow this article: https://cartflows.com/docs/add-custom-support-of-any-payment-gateway/

The custom file in which you have added support of your payment gateway for CartFlows upsell/downsell should be stored/saved in the folder/directory named as `gateway-files`.
